This report investigates the application of statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) models for short-term load forecasting (STLF) in mini-grids. The aim is to compare the performance of various models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, Boosted Trees algorithms, and several neural network architectures such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
A quantitative research design was employed, leveraging both classical time series analysis and advanced AI techniques. The dataset, sourced from the REMOTE EU research project, provides detailed time-series data on power generation, consumption, and meteorological conditions. Key error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Percentage of Critical Events for Margin X (PCE_MX) were used to evaluate model performance.
Results indicate that AI models generally outperformed statistical models, with CatBoost demonstrating superior accuracy. However, SARIMA and ARIMAX models achieved competitive results under specific conditions, promising better operational efficiency and system reliability for optimizing energy balance and minimizing costs in mini-grids. However, the study also identified limitations, including computational resource constraints and the need for model-specific optimizations.
